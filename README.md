<h2>:balance_scale:	ABOUT ME: :balance_scale:	</h2>
Hard-working, enthusiastic, with good logical and communication skills.   
Love music, reading, art and programming.  
My favourite part about programming is that you never stop   
learning and you can find many different solutions to a problem.
Throughout my life I gathered different experiences and I am always open to something new! :100:
